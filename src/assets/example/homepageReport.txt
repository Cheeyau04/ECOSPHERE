This month, AC1 consumed approximately 500 kWh, accounting for 35% of total energy usage. As the weather warms, the frequency of AC use has increased, with notable spikes in energy consumption during afternoon and evening hours. Compared to the previous month, AC1â€™s energy usage rose by 12%, primarily due to extended operational hours to cope with temperature changes. Regular cleaning of filters and inspection of system performance is recommended to maintain efficiency. Additionally, adjusting temperature settings or implementing smart control during off-peak hours could further reduce energy consumption.
